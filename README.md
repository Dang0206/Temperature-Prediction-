Introduction
This project focuses on the use of machine learning techniques and environmental fluctuations to predict the annual average temperature, which has a significant impact on life forms on Earth as well as human activities, especially in the field of agriculture. First, the raw data is preprocessed to eliminate inconsistencies and missing values, followed by data analysis. Then, it is input into regression models to predict the average temperature, and the results from each algorithm are compared to determine which one performs best. This prediction not only helps improve the quality of life but also contributes to economic development, environmental protection, and the mitigation of climate change risks. 
Dataset identification
By utilizing the Kaggle search tool, I was able to identify a comprehensive dataset related to average temperature and its correlation with environmental factors, which can be accessed via the following link: 
 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhadramohit/climate-change-dataset 
The dataset consists of 1,000 data points documenting information on global climate change indicators (2000-2024), with a primary focus on average temperature, CO2 emissions, etc.
